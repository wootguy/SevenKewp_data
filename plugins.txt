// List plugin paths here that you want to be loaded for all maps.
// Edits to this file take effect on map change.
// The order of plugins matters. Earlier plugins can prevent later ones from executing hooks.

// Paths are automatically prefixed with "plugins/server/" and can load from either
// the valve or valve_downloads content folders.
// For example, if you want to load the plugin located at
//   'valve_downloads/plugins/server/AntiBlock.dll'
// then you only need to write "Antiblock" on a blank line, as seen below.
// Remove the "//" before "AntiBlock" if you actually want to load it.
// Any lines beginning with "//" are ignored,

// AntiBlock
